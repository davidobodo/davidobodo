## What happened the other day

- **ME**: In love with all things [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- **MY BRAIN**: No it's [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) 😡
- **ME**: But it's [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) we mostly write ?
- **MY BRAIN**: Its Just [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) with types, so you should actually tell people its [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
- **ME**: But they are still different now
- **MY BRAIN**: C'mon let's not do this all day 😫. If you are being sincere, we actually write even more than just the [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) you hold so dearly.
  Don't we spend a huge chunk of our time converting designs into pixel perfect pages with [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) & [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)?

  And even though [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) are frameworks, haven't we spent a lot of time building enterprise grade applications both personally and with teams using them?

  Don't even get me started on the various amount of times we have used [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) and [Enzyme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/enzyme) to write tests.

- **ME**: You are now mentioning frameworks and tools built with the language, I was only telling them about the language 😤
- **MY BRAIN**: I thought we had this discussion last night to still tell them about the various frameworks we've used and are still using so what are you saying?🤦🏽
- **ME**: We didn't reach a conclusion because there are lots of frameworks we have used and are still using. In `frontend` there's still [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/overview), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/), [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), even old man legend [JQuery](https://jquery.com/).

  Thereafter let's not forget `backend` where we use [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) and since you are always curious, you even went along to start learning [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) and [Web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3) stuff.

- **MY BRAIN**: (Sips blood from a vein nearby 🥤)

- **ME**: Were you not even bored the other day and started playing with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) for Mobile app development ?

- **MY BRAIN**: (Takes a bite of glucose 🍗 for the left hemisphere)

- **ME**: All I'm saying is that we can't list all the frameworks here, because they keep growing since technology keeps evolving.
- **MY BRAIN**: Whatever you say 😤. Just guide them to your [dedicated projects page on your portfolio](https://www.davidobodo.com/projects?open_filter=true).

## Who doesn't love analytics ?

<!-- ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=davidobodo.davidobodo) -->

![Profile views](https://gpvc.arturio.dev/davidobodo)

- **MY BRAIN**: Shouldn't profile views be private such that it's only us that can see it?

- **ME**: Well this was the most stressfree way, besides if you wanted it to be private so bad you could have given me the idea🤷🏽

- **MY BRAIN**: Errm not ready for that, besides this is perfectly fine . Hope you gave them a star?

- **ME**: Yeah I sure did [here](https://github.com/hehuapei/visitor-badge).

- **ME**: I Would have added some more analytics, like Recent activity, Github Statistics e.t.c but they don't track things done in organizations "private" repositories.

- **MY BRAIN**: Oh that's true. So the lovely people won't see all the work you did there right?

- **ME**: Yes they won't 😭😭😭😭.

- **MY BRAIN**: Don't cry 🤣🤣🤣🤣, the work and contribution belongs to the organization.
